# 1000 Genomes Project data by ancestry groups

This directory stores scripts that prepare [__1000 Genomes__](https://www.internationalgenome.org/) genotype array data by ancestry groups, which then can be used to visualize LD in [__GeneticsMakie.jl__](https://github.com/mmkim1210/GeneticsMakie.jl). To get started, run scripts in `src` in order. 

The ancestry notation is as follows:  
- AFR: African
- AMR: American
- EAS: East Asian
- EUR: European
- SAS: South Asian
